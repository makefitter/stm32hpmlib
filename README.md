# stm32hpmlib
A library for interfacing to Honeywell HPM particle sensor from an STM32 microcontroller

This library has been written to interface specifically with the HPMA115S0-XXX particle sensor, but may work with other models.

Note: the file stm3232hpmlib.c includes the STM32 HAL header file for the specific microcontroller model, and this should be updated as necessary.
